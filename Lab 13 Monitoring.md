# SQL Server Diagnostic Tools Guide

This guide explains how to download and use the following diagnostic tools in SQL Server:

* `Glenn Berry's Diagnostic Queries`
* `sp_Blitz`
* `sp_WhoIsActive`
* `sp_PressureDetector`
* `sp_HumanEvents`

## üß™ Exercise: Monitor and resolve a blocking situation using built-in tools

You will create a blocking situation, find more information about it and then decide which connection to KILL to resolve the situation. Note that KILL shouldn‚Äôt be taken lightly, so use with care in real life!

* A tip is to close all query windows first.
* Open 3 query windows in the Adventureworks database. Let‚Äôs call them QW1, QW2 and QW3.
* You will work with the Person.Person table.

### In QW1

* Start a transaction
* Update BusinessEntityID = 1, and set FirstName = 'Kenneth'
* Leave this query window open

```sql
BEGIN TRAN
UPDATE Person.Person
SET FirstName = 'Kenneth'
WHERE BusinessEntityID = 1;
-- Don't commit or rollback yet
```

### In QW2 and QW3 (do the same in both)

```sql
SELECT * FROM Person.Person;
```

* Now QW2 and QW3 should be blocked
* Use Activity Monitor to check out the blocking situation
* Which SessionIDs are blocked?
* Which SessionID is the root cause to the blocking situation?
* Use `sp_who` and `sp_who2` to get the same information
* You can also select from `sys.dm_tran_locks` (note: lots of rows, most from XML-related objects)
* Terminate the session which is the root cause
* Verify that QW2 and QW3 now receive data
* Optionally download `sp_whoisactive` (below) and try it out
* Close all query windows

## üóìÔ∏è Download and Installation of useful thirdparty tools:

### 1. Glenn Berry's Diagnostic Queries

**Author:** Glenn Berry
**URL:** [https://glennsqlperformance.com/resources/](https://glennsqlperformance.com/resources/)

**Installation / Usage:**

1. Go to the link above and select the T-SQL script that matches your SQL Server version, e.g., *SQL Server 2019 Diagnostic Information Queries*.
2. Click on the download arrow which looks like this. Do not register or log in.

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b33b14c-b551-4dd5-ac03-e97a24b45adb)

3. Open the script in SSMS.
4. Click Execute. The entire script will run. It will take around 15 seconds. Examine the results
5. Next, run the parts you're interested in ‚Äì you don't need to run everything.

**Sample exercise:**

```sql
-- Find top cached SPs by average CPU time
USE AdventureWorks
GO
SELECT TOP(25)
    p.name AS [SP Name],
    qs.total_worker_time / qs.execution_count AS [AvgCPU],
    qs.execution_count,
    qs.total_worker_time,
    qs.last_execution_time
FROM sys.procedures AS p  
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_procedure_stats AS qs  
    ON p.[object_id] = qs.[object_id]  
ORDER BY [AvgCPU] DESC;
```

* Load your server with some queries and re-run the script to observe changes.For example

```sql
USE AdventureWorks
GO
CREATE PROC dbo.proc1 AS 
SELECT * FROM AdventureWorks.Person.Person
ORDER BY 1,2,3,4,5
GO
EXEC dbo.proc1
```

### 2. sp\_Blitz

**Author:** Brent Ozar Unlimited
**URL:** [https://github.com/BrentOzarULTD/SQL-Server-First-Responder-Kit](https://github.com/BrentOzarULTD/SQL-Server-First-Responder-Kit)

**Installation:**

1. Click on `sp_Blitz.sql` in the repo.
2. Click "Raw" and copy all contents.
3. Paste into SSMS and execute in the master database to install it. The stored procedure dbo.sp_blitz is created

**To run sp\_Blitz:**

```sql
EXEC sp_Blitz;
```

**Exercises:**

* Run `sp_Blitz` immediately after installation to get a full list of issues.
* Try creating a table without a primary key or setting unsafe options like `AUTO_SHRINK`, then re-run `sp_Blitz` to see how it's flagged.

```sql
-- Create a database and enable auto_shrink
CREATE DATABASE shrinkdb;
GO
ALTER DATABASE shrinkdb SET AUTO_SHRINK ON;
GO
USE shrinkdb;
EXEC sp_Blitz;
```

* You should see a Priority 10 warning for "Auto Shrink is Enabled"

### 3. sp\_WhoIsActive

**Author:** Adam Machanic
**URL:** [https://github.com/amachanic/sp\_whoisactive](https://github.com/amachanic/sp_whoisactive)

**Installation:**

1. Click on  `who_is_active.sql`
2. Clic Raw
3. Select the contents, copy the contents, paste it in SSMS and execute in SSMS to install

**To run it:**

```sql
EXEC dbo.sp_WhoIsActive;
```

Try this blocking scenario:

```sql
-- In Window 1
BEGIN TRAN
UPDATE Adventureworks.person.person
SET Lastname = 'Jones' WHERE BusinessEntityID = 1;
```

```sql
-- In Window 2
SELECT * FROM Adventureworks.person.person;
```

Then run:

```sql
-- In Window 1
EXEC dbo.sp_WhoIsActive;
```

And clean up:

```sql
-- In Window 1
ROLLBACK TRAN;
```

### 4. sp\_PressureDetector

**Author:** Erik Darling
**URL:** [https://github.com/erikdarlingdata/DarlingData](https://github.com/erikdarlingdata/DarlingData)

**Installation:**

1. Open the folder `sp_PressureDetector` and open `sp_PressureDetector.sql`
2. Copy and paste into SSMS, then run it

**To use it:**

```sql
EXECUTE sp_PressureDetector;
```


*There is not likely a lot of pressure on your server...*

### 5. sp\_HumanEvents

**Author:** Erik Darling
**URL:** [https://github.com/erikdarlingdata/DarlingData](https://github.com/erikdarlingdata/DarlingData)

**Installation:**

1. Go to the GitHub repo and download the install script in `/sp_HumanEvents/`
2. Run the file in SSMS

**To use it:**

```sql
-- In Window 1
USE Adventureworks;
EXEC dbo.sp_HumanEvents @event_type = 'query', @query_duration_ms = 1, @seconds_sample = 20, @database_name = 'AdventureWorks';
```

```sql
-- In Window 2 (while the above is running)
SELECT * FROM person.person;
```

Go back to Window 1. The query will be captured.

## üß† Tips

* Run these tools from a DBA or admin database to avoid cluttering production databases
* Use SQL Agent Jobs or custom dashboards to schedule and monitor them regularly
